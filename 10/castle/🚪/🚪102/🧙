 ðŸ§™ AVERY THE MAGE:
 Heyyyyy! You must be Inspector Shell!
 I'm Avery the Mage. It's a pleasure to find some humans here.
 Don't say a word. You came here because that drama queen
 Miss Navi ask you to, didn't you?

 ðŸ•µ  INSPECTOR SHELL:
 Drama queen?
 ðŸ§™ AVERY THE MAGE:
 Yes. She came here this morning asking to use my crystal ball
 and she didn't even tell me what she was going to use it for.
 She probably just wanted to find her car keys, like everyone else.

 ðŸ•µ  INSPECTOR SHELL:
 She's looking for a precious possession she lost. Can your magic ball find it?
 ðŸ§™ AVERY THE MAGE:
 Sure it can! You can find any lost object with it! 
 ðŸ•µ  INSPECTOR SHELL:
 Why don't you let her use it for a moment?
 ðŸ§™ AVERY THE MAGE:
 I'm the only one who can use it. And it's not cheap.

 ðŸ•µ  INSPECTOR SHELL:
 So how much does it cost?
 ðŸ§™ AVERY THE MAGE:
 I'm not interested in money, I just need some ingredients 
 to prepare some barely legal potions. Can you bring me
 an intact healthy brain, 400 ml of blood, some batteries,
 a cookie and a cup of coffee?

 ðŸ•µ  INSPECTOR SHELL:
 Cookies and coffee?
 ðŸ§™ AVERY THE MAGE:
 Mmm. Yes, I'm a little hungry
 ðŸ•µ  INSPECTOR SHELL:
 Okay. I'll do my best


FINAL:

  ðŸ§™ AVERY THE MAGE:
 Wow! I'm so impressed you got all the ingredients.
 And my coffee and cookies too!
 ðŸ•µ  INSPECTOR SHELL:
 Please, now tell me where Miss Navi's secret thing is.

 ðŸ§™ AVERY THE MAGE:
 Okay, let me ask my magic crystal ball
 ðŸ•µ  INSPECTOR SHELL:
 ...

 ðŸ§™ AVERY THE MAGE:
 Hmm.. I see...
 ðŸ•µ  INSPECTOR SHELL:
 What do you see?!
 ðŸ§™ AVERY THE MAGE:
 Miss Navi's most precious belonging is...
 ðŸ•µ  INSPECTOR SHELL:
 WHAT?!

 ðŸ§™ AVERY THE MAGE:
 It's a ladybird!
 ðŸ•µ  INSPECTOR SHELL:
 A ladybird?
 ðŸ§™ AVERY THE MAGE:
 Yes, it seems like be her pet. And pets are totally prohibited in 
 Villa Feristela. That's why she didn't want to say what it was.

 ðŸ•µ  INSPECTOR SHELL:
 Okay, so where is it? Who stole it?
 ðŸ§™ AVERY THE MAGE:
 I don't know where it is exactly. It looks like a dark wet place.
 like a hole... Sorry but I can't see anything else.
