 ðŸ•µ  INSPECTOR SHELL:
 Are you okay?

 ðŸ¤– SHILOH THE ROBOT:
 Sorry Inspector Shell. My GPS system has an error.
 I can't fetch the requested data right now.
 ðŸ•µ  INSPECTOR SHELL:
 Can't you remember where you were last night?

 ðŸ¤– SHILOH THE ROBOT:
 Remember? I can't do that. But if I knew the error code
 maybe I could fix my GPS malfunction.
 If you help me find my exit code, I'll be able to give you
 the data you requested.
 ðŸ•µ  INSPECTOR SHELL:
 Help you find what?
