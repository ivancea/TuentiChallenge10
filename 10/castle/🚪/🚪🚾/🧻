ROSES ARE RED
VIOLETS ARE BLUE
YOU STOLE MY HEART YOU HAVE SUGAR EYES
(doesn't rhyme...)

ROSES ARE RED
VIOLETS ARE BLUE
I'VE LEARNED THE FULL MEANING OF SHARING AND CARING AND HAVING MY DREAMS ALL COME TRUE I'VE LEARNED THE FULL MEANING OF BEING IN LOVE BY BEING AND LOVING WITH YOU
(too long...)

ROSES ARE RED
VIOLETS ARE BLUE
LOOK AT THIS CROWN I STOLE IT FOR YOU
