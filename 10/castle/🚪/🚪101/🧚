 Oh Inspector Shell! Thank goodness you are here!
 Last night... Something terrible happened...
 When the lights went out.

 My beloved little... em...
 My most valuable belonging was stolen!

 You've got to help me...

 ðŸ•µ  INSPECTOR SHELL:
 So, your precious belonging is...

 ðŸ§š NAVI THE FAIRY:
 Em... It's a secret, I can't tell you. But you have to help me!

 ðŸ•µ  INSPECTOR SHELL:
 So, how do you want me to find something if I don't know what I'm looking for?

 ðŸ§š NAVI THE FAIRY:
 You're famous for being best detective worldwide. I'm sure you can do it! hehehe

 ðŸ•µ  INSPECTOR SHELL:

 ðŸ§š NAVI THE FAIRY:
 Great! Please, take my unique four-leaf clover as a present.
 It will bring you good luck!

 ðŸ•µ  INSPECTOR SHELL:
 ...
 At least tell me when you saw it last, or give me any clues you might have.

 ðŸ§š NAVI THE FAIRY:
 You could talk with Avery the Mage. She has a magic crystal ball.
 She is in room 102. Maybe she'll use her powers to help us.
