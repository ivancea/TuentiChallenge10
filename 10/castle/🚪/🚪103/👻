 Hey Inspector Shell! I'm Joey the Ghost!
 Is that a flashlight?!
 Can you help me find my ring? It just fell off my hand here
 in the room. It must be close, but I can't find it without any light.

 ðŸ‘» JOEY THE GHOST:
 Thank you Inspector!
 ðŸ•µ  INSPECTOR SHELL:
 Wait a minute. How can you wear rings if you don't have fingers?
 ðŸ‘» JOEY THE GHOST:
 Hehehe. That's why it fell off my hand. Hehehe.
