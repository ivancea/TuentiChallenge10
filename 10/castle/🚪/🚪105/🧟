 Hello. My name is Inspector Shell and I'm investigating a theft
 here in the hotel.
 ðŸ§Ÿ ELLIOTT THE ZOMBIE:
 Awesome. So you like riddles, eh?

 ðŸ•µ  INSPECTOR SHELL:
 Yes. Where were you last night? What were you doing?
 ðŸ§Ÿ ELLIOTT THE ZOMBIE:
 I was here solving riddles. Can you help me with this one?
 I've tried eating more brains, but I still can't solve it.

 ðŸ§Ÿ ELLIOTT THE ZOMBIE:
 Okay so here is the riddle.
    I went to the zombie market to buy some food to throw
    the perfect zombie party. I bought X brains.
    If I divide them between 2 zombies there will be 1 remaining brains.
    If I divide them between 3 zombies there will be 2 remaining brains.
    If I divide them between 4 zombies there will be 3 remaining brains.
    If I divide them between 5 zombies there will be 4 remaining brains.
    If I divide them between 6 zombies there will be 5 remaining brains.
    But if I divide them between 7 zombies there won't be any brains left!
    Do you know the minimum number X of brains I bought?
