 ðŸ§œ POSEIDON THE SEA KING:
 You, mere mortal, how you dare enter a king's room
 without permission?
 ðŸ•µ  INSPECTOR SHELL:
 Well, my name is Inspector Shell and...
 ðŸ§œ POSEIDON THE SEA KING:
 Are you a detective? Don't make me laugh, you don't even
 have a magnifying glass!

 ðŸ•µ  INSPECTOR SHELL:
 Are you a king? I don't see a crown.
 ðŸ§œ POSEIDON THE SEA KING:
 Unfortunately, my crown went missing during the blackout last night.

 ðŸ•µ  INSPECTOR SHELL:
 Hm... I see. I'm investigating another theft at this hotel.
 I'll let you know if I find anything.
 ðŸ§œ POSEIDON THE SEA KING:
 Okay. Thanks.
