 Hello???

 ðŸ§› LANDRY THE VAMPIRE:
 Hey, sorry, I'm writing some poetry. Wait a second, are you a detective?
 I don't know anything about any crimes that might have happened during the blackout.
 ðŸ•µ  INSPECTOR SHELL:
 Sure. Where were you last night?

 ðŸ§› LANDRY THE VAMPIRE:
 I spent all night writing poetry for my beloved.
 I wrote down a perfect rhyme for my poem somewhere, but now I can't find it.
 I was so inspired I can't remember where I wrote it down...
 ðŸ•µ  INSPECTOR SHELL:
 Sure. What about that crown?

 ðŸ§› LANDRY THE VAMPIRE:
 It's not mine and I have no idea what it's doing here. Take it if you want.
 ðŸ•µ  INSPECTOR SHELL:

 ðŸ§› LANDRY THE VAMPIRE:
 Please, help me finish my poem. You can read it.
 It's written on that scroll! If you get any ideas
 just talk to me again.
