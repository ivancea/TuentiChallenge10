 ðŸ¤µ MIKE THE STEWARD:
 Good Evening, sir. You must be Inspector Shell.
 Welcome to Villa Feristela. It's the perfect hotel for our spooky guests.
 We're so pleased to have you. We've been waiting.

 Sorry for the inconvenience. We lost the lights last night because of the storm.
 At least you brought a flashlight!

 The lights weren't the only thing that got lost last night.
 Someone took advantage of the blackout and stole one of Miss Navi's most precious belongings.

 Could you please help us find that extremely valuable... thing?
 The other guests are upstairs in their rooms. You can walk through 
 that door if you want to interrogate them. You might want to talk with Miss
 Navi first. You can find her in room 101.
